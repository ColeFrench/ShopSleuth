# ShopSleuth
A client-side mod to assist with the Bed Wars Invisible Shop challenge.

## Installation
This mod is still in early development, so there are no releases yet. To build it yourself, follow the setup instructions then execute `./gradlew build`.

## Setup
### Dependencies
First, you'll need a fork of [ForgeGradle](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle) that resolves ColeFrench/ForgeGradle#1. You're welcome to clone mine.

Then, install that fork to your local Maven repo via `./gradlew install`.

### Finally
Clone this repo and check that you are using your local ForgeGradle installation. (If using mine, then you should already be fine.) Run `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`.

You can find unofficial/unaffiliated Minecraft Forge Javadocs here: https://skmedix.github.io/ForgeJavaDocs/javadoc/forge/1.8.9-11.15.1.2318/.
